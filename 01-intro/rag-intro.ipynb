Then I placed raw data trips into external tables and when I executed dbt run I got an error message: Parquet column 'passenger_count' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE.

      "\n",
      "There are several reasons why BigQuery might return an error when you try to run `dbt run`:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data type mismatch (e.g., Parquet INT64 vs. DOUBLE):** This can happen if columns in your data files (like `passenger_count`, `payment_type`, `RatecodeID`, `VendorID`, `trip_type`) have different data formats.\n",
      "    *   **Solution:** Add `df[col] = df[col].astype('Int64')` transformation to the problematic columns in your data loading script.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Incorrect `date_trunc` syntax in a SQL model (e.g., `dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql`):**\n",
      "    *   **Solution:** Change `date_trunc('month', pickup_datetime) as revenue_month` to `date_trunc(pickup_datetime, month) as revenue_month`, ensuring \"month\" is not surrounded by quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Location change in dbt without dataset recreation:** If you change the location in dbt, the old dataset might still exist in BigQuery causing issues.\n",
      "    *   **Solution:** Remove the dataset from BigQuery that was created by dbt, then run `dbt run` again to recreate it with the correct location.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Permission denied when using external tables (e.g., `fhv_tripdata`):**\n",
      "    *   **Solution:** Go to your dbt cloud service account and add the `Storage Object Admin` and `Storage Admin` roles in addition to `BigQuery Admin`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Issues when running the dbt project on production:**\n",
