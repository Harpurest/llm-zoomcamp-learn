Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately and comprehensively addresses the generated question by extracting all relevant details from the original answer, including the FAQ's existence, name, purpose, and the direct link."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly extracts the specific link and its location (GitHub repository) from the original answer. However, the original answer clearly states this link is for a 'Data Engineering Zoomcamp FAQ' and for 'inspiration on how to structure questions and answers,' not for 'signing up.' The generated answer implies it is a sign-up link, which is not supported by the original text."
NON_RELEVANT,"The original answer explicitly states 'Check this document for inspiration on how to structure your questions and answers: Data Engineering Zoomcamp FAQ', providing a direct pointer to how one can structure questions and answers. The generated answer falsely claims 'there is no information on how to structure your questions and answers for the course', directly contradicting the provided context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly states that the provided context does not contain information on where or how to sign up for the course, which is accurate as the original answer is an FAQ document. However, the generated answer then hallucinates the statement 'It only mentions that you can still join even if it has already started,' which is not present in the original text. The hallucination prevents it from being classified as 'RELEVANT', despite the initial correct assessment of the context's limitations."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly states that the provided context does not explicitly label the link from the GitHub repository as a 'sign-up link'. However, it fails to acknowledge that the context *does* mention a 'course GitHub repository' and 'a link' within it (https://airtable.com/shryxwLd0COOEaqXo). By giving a blanket denial, the answer is incomplete and does not fully utilize the available information in the original text, making it only partly relevant."
